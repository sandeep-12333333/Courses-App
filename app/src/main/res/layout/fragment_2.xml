    <TextView android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent" android:textColor="#E91E63" android:textSize="20dp" android:text="Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted computing services and IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Users can obtain technology services such as processing power, storage and databases from a cloud provider, eliminating the need for purchasing, operating and maintaining on-premises physical data centers and servers. A cloud can be private, public or a hybrid. A public cloud sells services to anyone on the internet. A private cloud is a proprietary network or a data center that supplies hosted services to a limited number of people, with certain access and permissions settings. A hybrid cloud offers a mixed computing environment where data and resources can be shared between both public and private clouds. Regardless of the type, the goal of cloud computing is to provide easy, scalable access to computing resources and IT services."/>
